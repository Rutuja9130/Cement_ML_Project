 Cement Compression Strength Prediction
This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project focused on predicting the compression strength of cement using various input features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information on the components and properties of the cement mix, as well as the resulting compression strength. The data is stored in the data directory in CSV format. The dataset contains the following columns:

Cement (kg/m3)
Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m3)
Fly Ash (kg/m3)
Water (kg/m3)
Superplasticizer (kg/m3)
Coarse Aggregate (kg/m3)
Fine Aggregate (kg/m3)
Age (day)
Concrete Compression Strength (MPa)
Code
The code for this project is written in Python and includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts. The code is stored in the src directory and is organized as follows:

preprocessing.py: Preprocessing script for cleaning and transforming the raw data.
model_training.py: Script for training various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
evaluation.py: Script for evaluating the trained models and generating performance metrics.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting the compression strength of cement. The results show that it is possible to accurately predict the strength of cement using various input features. The code and data provided in this repository can be used as a starting point for further research or for real-world applications.

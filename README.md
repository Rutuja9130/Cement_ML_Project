 Cement Compression Strength Prediction
This repository contains code and data for a machine learning project focused on predicting the compression strength of cement using various input features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information on the components and properties of the cement mix, as well as the resulting compression strength. The data is stored in the data directory in CSV format. The dataset contains the following columns:

Cement (kg/m3)
Blast Furnace Slag (kg/m3)
Fly Ash (kg/m3)
Water (kg/m3)
Superplasticizer (kg/m3)
Coarse Aggregate (kg/m3)
Fine Aggregate (kg/m3)
Age (day)
Concrete Compression Strength (MPa)
Code
The code for this project is written in Python and includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts. The code is stored in the src directory and is organized as follows:

preprocessing.py: Preprocessing script for cleaning and transforming the raw data.
model_training.py: Script for training various machine learning models on the preprocessed data.
evaluation.py: Script for evaluating the trained models and generating performance metrics.
Usage
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
Navigate to the repository directory: cd repo
Install the required Python packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the preprocessing script: python src/preprocessing.py
Run the model training script: python src/model_training.py
Run the evaluation script: python src/evaluation.py
The output of each script will be saved in the output directory.
